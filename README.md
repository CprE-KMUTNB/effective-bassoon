## About The Project

**Project Description:**

**Introduction:**
The myFridge Expiry Date Reminder and Notification Web Application is a user-friendly and efficient solution designed to help user to manage their fridge contents by reminding them of the impending expiration dates of stored products. The application aims to reduce food wastage and improve household organization by providing timely alerts and notifications for items approaching their expiration dates.

**Features:**

1. **Product Entry:**
   Users can manually input product information such as name, category, purchase date, and expiration date into the application. They can also upload images for easier identification.

2. **Expiry Date Tracking:**
   The application will calculate the remaining time until the expiration date for each product entered. This information will be displayed prominently in the user's dashboard.

3. **Automated Reminders:**
   The core feature of the application is the automated reminder system. Users will receive notifications via email or SMS in advance of a product's expiration date. These reminders will include relevant details like the name of the product and the number of days remaining until expiration.

4. **Customizable Notifications:**
   Users can customize their notification preferences, such as choosing whether to receive reminders daily, every few days, or weekly. They can also set the specific time of day they would like to receive reminders.

5. **Search and Filtering:**
   Users can easily search for specific products within their inventory and apply filters based on categories, expiration dates, or other attributes.
